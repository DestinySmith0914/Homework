<h3>What is blacksmithing?</h3>
<p>Blacksmithing is the ancient art of creating tools and objects out of heated metals that become soft enough to shape into a desired form. It has its roots in the iron age of 1500 BCE. Nowadays, there are people who still carry on this ancient process in more modern ways and here we will learn the basics of how it's done! Let's get started!</p>

<h3>Basic Tools</h3>
<p>When blacksmithing, there are 4 things you will need to start.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Forge</li>
  <li>Anvil</li>
  <li>Tongs</li>
  <li>Hammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's explain why all of these tools are necessary.
  Starting with the forge.
  A forge is a source of heat while in the blacksmithing process. It uses fire, air and fuel. When the fuel is heated, moving air into the forge helps in adding oxygen to the fire. This makes the fire hotter.
  Now that the forge has heated your metal of choice, you need something to shape your metal on. This is where the anvil comes in. The anvil is typically suggested to be at least 50 times heavier than the hammer you are using. This ensures that it is sturdy enough to withstand the blows from the hammer.
  But, before you use the anvil, you need a way to move the hot metal to it and something to shape it with. Now the tongs and hammer come into play. The tongs are a safe way to transfer hot metal from the forge onto the anvil. The hammer will be used to beat the hot metal into shape.
